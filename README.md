# Reddit Clone Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of our Reddit Clone, developed as part of the Software Engineering course at Cairo University Faculty of Engineering! This project is a comprehensive endeavor by a large team of 18 students, aimed at replicating the core functionalities of Reddit. Our objective is to provide users with a platform to create posts, comment, upvote, and engage in discussions on various topics. The frontend is built using React, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
